                The `IRecordedValueService` allows users to record sensor values either by sensor name or by sensor ID.
                This service provides an option to log data from sensors that are managed by this library.

            <SubTitle>Note on Custom Backend Integration</SubTitle>
            <TextBlock>
                Important: The value recording methods in this service offer flexibility for users who have their
                own backend or device communication protocols. If your devices are not directly connected to this
                libraryâ€™s services but use your own backend, you can still use the `RecordValue` methods to log values,
                while leveraging other library features like retrieving recorded values or managing sensors.

            <TextBlock>
                Records a value for a sensor using its device name. If an `endUserId` is provided, the value will be
                recorded
                for the specified end user. If no `endUserId` is provided, the logged-in user will be used by default.

                Note: This method is particularly useful if your devices communicate with your own backend
                using custom protocols. You can still use this method to log values to the library while managing your
                device communication separately.

                access
                to the sensor's ID and want to log values. Devices can communicate with a separate backend, and
                this method can still be used for logging purposes.
